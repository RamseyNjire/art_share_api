# ART SHARE API

This is a simple project to help me get a deeper understanding of the MVC model without the views. It's an API for users to make and share art with each other.

In this project, I

- Implement some basic routes;
- Build models for users and art, as well as others, including a join table (artshares);
- Write migrations for those models to evolve the schema;
- Write DB- and model-level validations for certain attributes;
- Seed the database with some starter data;
- Create an API layer using different controllers to handle requests from the API endpoints;
- Use Postman to test each of the endpoints to make sure they are working properly;
- Use gitflow.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Postman

## Getting Started
- Clone the project to your local machine;
- `cd` into the project directory;
- Run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems;
- Run `rails db:create`;
- Run `rails db:migrate`;
- Run `rails s` to start a server in your computer;
- Run `rails routes` to see the available API endpoints (ignoring Rails generated routes, of course);
